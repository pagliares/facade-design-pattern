# Facade design pattern and the design principle of the least knowledge

Repository with source code of the examples used in the classes about the design pattern Facade and the design principle of the least knowledge, taught by Rodrigo Martins Pagliares at UNIFAL-MG.

## Examples

I use a simple Java program that evolves from a simple example without the use of the Facade design pattern to a final version that uses Facade and adheres to the design principle of least knoledge.

To ease contrasting the evolution of the examples in this directory, I created a Multi Module Maven Project. In this way, all examples can be loaded and built together in the IDE of your choice (I use IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition).
